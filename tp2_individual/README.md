## Individual Project

This repository serves SRCR project about path finding algorithms and data normalization whose goal is to query the final system about paths (solutions) between points using depth first, breadth first, A* and Greedy search algorithms. The final report contains all the query analysis, algorithms explanations and time comparison between them.

#### Project structure

- **datasets**: raw/processed datasets.
- **documents**: assignment and some usefull documents.
- **src**: source code for both java parser and prolog knowledge database and path finding algorithms.
